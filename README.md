## About: 
  - Author: Nicholas Green
  - Date: 7/9/24
  - Built with: Python 3.12.2
  - Revision Control: https://github.com/JewellInstruments/RUBY_BON_Program.git
  - This program will calibrate the assembly of the analog RUBY MEMS sensors.
  
  ### For the JMx
  The Inclinometers and Accelerometers can be completely calibrated here.
  This app will measure on board resistors and calculate secondary resistors to meet desired gain

## Equipment:
  Application is hardware specific, substitutions of equipment are not recommended unless communication compatibility is evaluated.
